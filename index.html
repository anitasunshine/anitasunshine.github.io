          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Anita! I am passionate about bringing positive change (a little bit of sunshine) wherever I go. During my free time, I like to do a little bit of everything: explore, garden, cook, arts & crafts, hang out with friends, sing karaoke, volunteer, play sports, have deep conversations, and laugh. My partner, Alvin, and I now call Long Island City, NY home because we love to be in close proximity to the city, but far enough to have peace and tranquility. I have been in love with the liveliness, diversity, and idiosyncrasies of city life for most of my life. I love being able to have so many people around but also not feel suffocated by them. People generally mind their own business while also eager to lend a helping hand.
          </p>

            My older sister, Jane, and I are first generation American-born Chinese (ABC) and native New York City residents. Both of my parents came to New York City in 1988 where they met each other at an English night class. I was a curious child but always too reserved. I think I've had many missed opportunities because of that but I also know it is never too late to learn and open up to the world, which is what I have been doing over the years. I am still naturally on the shy side but I have grown to love and appreciate the beauty of opening up to people and new experiences.          
          </p>

            What is the meaning of life? For me, it is the need to make the most out of my life while I am here. Although I love the idea of living life to the fullest by going on the most amazing adventures and going to the most incredible places, that shouldn't overshadow what we do for others. I want to live a life where I contribute to bettering the lives of others through action and pushing for positive change. In my almost three decades of life, although I haven't seen as much as many others, I have seen enough racial, environmental, and social injustices and how they intersect and feed into each other that I can't sit idly. I am on a journey to learn from others and join the fight.

            There are many different topics that I want to focus on, investigate, discuss, and highlight. I will try to accomplish that using several mediums which will also satisfy my desire to try on several project ideas. I want this website to help me share with the world many things that I hold near and dear.

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
          For the past several years, I have been working in the field of environmental education and urban agriculture, and taking part in various stewardship and environmental conservation projects. My heart and mind draws me to working with nature and the community. I have worked with <a href="https://www.thesca.org/" target="_blank">The Student Conservation Association</a>, <a href="https://ucceny.org/enyf/" target="_blank">East New York Farms!</a>, and currently working with <a href="https://earthmatter.org/" target="_blank">Earth Matter NY Inc.</a> Each step of the way gave me more perspective on the things we must do to preserve our environment and better the lives of not only people, but all living creatures. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          I lead workshops and consult on the following topics:
        </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Zero waste events & lifestyle</li>
            <li>Upcycling crafts</li>
            <li>Small scale composting</li>
          </ul>

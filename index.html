          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Anita! I am passionate about bringing positive change (a little bit of sunshine) wherever I go. During my free time, I like to do a little bit of everything: explore, garden, cook, arts & crafts, hang out with friends, sing karaoke, volunteer, play sports, have deep conversations, and laugh. My partner, Alvin, and I now call Long Island City, NY home. I have been in love with the liveliness, diversity, and idiosyncrasies of city life for most of my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            My older sister, Jane, and I are first generation American-born Chinese (ABC) and native New York City residents. Both of my parents came to New York City in 1988 where they met each other at an English night class. I was a curious child but always very reserved. I think I've had many missed opportunities because of that but I also know it is never too late to learn and open up more to the world, which is what I have been doing over the years. I am still naturally on the shy side but I have grown to love and appreciate the beauty of opening up to people and new experiences.          
          </p>
          <p>
            What is the meaning of life? For me, it is the need to make the most out of my life while I am here. Although I love the idea of living life to the fullest by going on the most amazing adventures and going to the most incredible places, that shouldn't overshadow what we do for others and the impact we have on our surroundings. I want to live a sustainable and intentional life where I contribute to bettering the lives of others through action and pushing for positive change. In my almost three decades of life, although I haven't seen as much as many others, I have seen enough racial, environmental, and social injustices and how they intersect and feed into each other that I can't sit idly. I am on a journey to learn from others and be a part of the fight.

            There are many different topics that I want to focus on, investigate, discuss, and highlight. I will try to accomplish that using several mediums which will also satisfy my desire to try on several project ideas. I want this website to help me share many things that I hold near and dear.

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
          For the past several years, I have been working in the field of environmental education, urban agriculture, waste management, and composting and volunteering for various environmental stewardship and conservation projects, litter clean-ups, and community events. My heart and mind draws me to working with nature and the community. I have worked with <a href="https://www.thesca.org/" target="_blank">The Student Conservation Association</a>, <a href="https://ucceny.org/enyf/" target="_blank">East New York Farms!</a>, and <a href="https://earthmatter.org/" target="_blank">Earth Matter NY Inc.</a> I am currently serving on the <a href="https://queensswab.nyc/" target="_blank">Queens Solid Waste Advisory Board</a> in the Education Committee, Organics Recovery Committee, and Communications Committee. Every step of the way gives me more perspective on the things we must do to preserve our environment and better the lives of not only people, but all living creatures.
        </p>
        <p>  
          I lead workshops and consult on the following topics:
        </p> 
          <ul>
            <li>Zero waste events & lifestyle</li>
            <li>Upcycling crafts</li>
            <li>Small-scale home composting</li>
          </ul>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Anita! I am passionate about bringing positive change (a little bit of sunshine) wherever I go. During my free time, I like to do a little bit of everything: explore, garden, cook, arts & crafts, hang out with friends, sing karaoke, volunteer, play sports, travel, have deep conversations, and laugh. My partner, Alvin, and I now call Long Island City, NY home. I am in love with the liveliness, diversity, opportunities, and idiosyncrasies of city life.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a first generation American-born Chinese (ABC) and have lived in New York City all of my life. Both of my parents came to New York City in 1988 where they met each other at an English night class. I was a curious child but was always very reserved. I think I've had many missed opportunities because of that. I now fully embrace the idea that it is never too late to learn and open up more to the world, which is what I have been doing over the years. I am still naturally on the shy side but I have grown to love and appreciate the beauty of opening up to people and new experiences.          
            </p>
            <p>
              What is the meaning of life? For me, it is to make the most out of my life while I am here. Although I love the idea of living life to the fullest by going on the most amazing adventures and going to the most incredible places, that shouldn't overshadow what we do for others and the impact we have on the world and its inhabitants. I want to live a sustainable and intentional life where I contribute to bettering the lives of others through action and pushing for positive change. There is so much social, racial, and environmental injustices all around us that I can't sit idly. I am on a journey to continously learn from others and be a part of the fight.
            </p>

              There are many different topics that I want to focus on, investigate, discuss, and highlight. I will try to accomplish that using several mediums which will also satisfy my desire to try on several project ideas. I want this website to help me share many things that I hold near and dear.
